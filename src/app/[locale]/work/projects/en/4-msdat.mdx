## Overview

The **Multi-Source Data Analytics and Triangulation (MSDAT)** platform, commissioned and funded by the **Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation**, serves as a unified resource for analyzing and visualizing health indicators using multiple data sources, such as routine data, surveys, and global estimates. Developed for the **Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) Nigeria**, it enhances transparency, fosters data quality, and supports evidence-based decision-making to improve health outcomes and optimize resource allocation.

The platform is an essential resource for stakeholders, offering real-time insights and interactive visualizations to address critical health challenges at the national, state, and local levels.

## Related Project: ISS

Building on MSDAT, I also led the development of the **Integrated Support System (ISS)** for the ministry. This project integrated health data from various sources, enhancing operational capacity and scalability while addressing the needs of national health surveillance systems.
Bill gates sent the team and I a signed picture frame we all got to add our own signature on and had it hung on the office wall, it was a big inspiration to us.
