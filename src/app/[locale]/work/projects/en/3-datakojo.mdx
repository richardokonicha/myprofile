## Mention: Integrated Support System (ISS)

In addition to Datakojo, I led the development of the **Integrated Support System (ISS)**, a customized fork of Datakojo built for the Ministry of Health. As both the Lead Engineer and Product Leader, I ensured ISS was tailored to meet the ministry's specific needs, supervised deployments, and facilitated field tests. ISS further demonstrates the scalability and adaptability of the Datakojo platform in addressing sector-specific challenges.
